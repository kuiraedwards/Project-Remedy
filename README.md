# Project-Remedy

To run app:
- Have 2 seperate terminals, one for flask and one to run react.

- Flask terminal commands: 
    - run 'python3 -m venv venv' IF the venv' folder isn't there
    - run 'source venv/bin/activate '
    - run 'flask run'
        - if it says port 5000 is already in use, quit/close your editor and open it again then run the commands

- React commands:
    - run 'npm start'
    - 'npm i' is to make sure everything needed is installed if you have errors
