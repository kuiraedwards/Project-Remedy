# Project-Remedy

To run app:
- Have 2 seperate terminals, one for flask and one to run react.
- You will probably have to install flask the first time you run the app.
    - `pip3 install flask` or however you can install flask

- Flask terminal commands: 
    - run `python3 -m venv venv` IF the "venv" folder isn't there
    - run `source venv/bin/activate`
    - run `flask run`
        - if it says port 5000 is already in use, quit/close your editor and open it again then run the commands

- React commands:
    - run `npm start`
    - running `npm i` is to make sure everything needed is installed if you have installation errors
